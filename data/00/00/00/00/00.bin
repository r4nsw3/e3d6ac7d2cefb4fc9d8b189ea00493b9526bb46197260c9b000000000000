  |   Civilization is a turn-based strategy game in which you attempt to    |

  |   history's most renowned leaders as you attempt to build the           |
  |   greatest civilization the world has ever known.                       |
  |                                                                         |

  |   * PLAY YOUR WAY: The path to victory is the one you determine.        |

  |   * DYNAMIC DIPLOMACY: Interactions with other civilizations change     |
  |     over the course of the game, from primitive first interactions      |
